Dear User, 
<br />
<br/>

For $Model.PlatePlanName$ $Model.Remark$, UTM is not able to create observation columns: $Model.MissingColumns$<br/>
After adding required columns (at all levels of the field(s)), you will receive an email when all the marker results are in Phenome.<br/><br/>

Best Regards, <br/>
UTM
